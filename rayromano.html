        <h1>JAMIE FLOYD:  <em>UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</em></h1><br>
        <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</p><br>
        <h1>DONNA AND SCOTT: <em>RESCUED RENOVATION</em></h1><br>
        <p>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"</p><br>
        <h1>DAVID SIEGEL: <em>DOUBLED THE VALUE</em></h1><br>
        <p>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."</p>
